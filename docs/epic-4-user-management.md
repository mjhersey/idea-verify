# Epic 4: Basic User Management (MVP Scope)

**Epic Goal**: Provide essential user account features and evaluation history for MVP launch, focusing on core functionality needed to satisfy functional requirements FR5 and FR9.

**MVP Scope Notes:** This epic has been streamlined for MVP delivery. Advanced features (preferences, sophisticated iteration, billing flows) have been deferred to Post-MVP Epic 6 to accelerate time-to-market by ~2 weeks while retaining all core value delivery.

## Story 4.1: Basic User Dashboard

**As a user,**
**I want to see all my past evaluations,**
**so that I can track my ideas and access previous results.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. User dashboard showing evaluation list in chronological order
2. Basic evaluation cards with title, date, status, and overall score
3. Click to open full report functionality
4. Simple status indicators (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Failed)
5. Basic pagination for users with many evaluations

**Dependencies:** Requires Epic 1 Story 1.3 for user authentication and Epic 3 Story 3.5 for results data.

## Story 4.2: Simple Idea Re-evaluation

**As a user,**
**I want to modify and re-evaluate my business idea,**
**so that I can improve its viability based on feedback.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. "Modify & Re-evaluate" button visible on completed evaluation results
2. Simple text area pre-populated with original idea description
3. Character limit validation (50-5000 characters) consistent with original submission
4. Submit button to start new evaluation with modified idea
5. Clear link between original evaluation and re-evaluation in dashboard
6. Ability to view both evaluations separately

**Dependencies:** Requires Story 4.1 for dashboard integration and Epic 1 Story 1.4 for idea submission API.

## Story 4.3: Basic Usage Limits & Tracking

**As a user,**
**I want to understand my current usage limits,**
**so that I know how many evaluations I have remaining.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Track evaluation count per user account
2. Display remaining evaluations on dashboard (e.g., "3 of 5 evaluations used")
3. Show usage limit in navigation or header area
4. Display "evaluation limit reached" message when limit exceeded
5. Provide contact information (email) for upgrade requests
6. Simple admin interface to adjust user limits manually

**Dependencies:** Requires Epic 1 Story 1.3 for user tracking and Story 4.1 for dashboard display.
