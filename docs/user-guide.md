# AI-Powered Business Idea Validation Platform - User Guide

Welcome to your personal AI business validation team! Our platform helps
entrepreneurs validate their business ideas through comprehensive AI-powered
analysis in under 30 minutes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- A valid email address
- Your business idea (even if it's just a rough concept!)
- 5-10 minutes to get set up

### Why Use Our Platform?

Traditional business validation is either too expensive (consultants charge
$10K-50K) or too shallow (basic AI responses). Our platform bridges that gap
with specialized AI agents that conduct real market research and provide
structured, actionable insights.

  it)
- **Content**: Plain text (no special formatting needed)

### Step-by-Step Submission

1. **Navigate to Idea Submission**
   - Click "Submit New Idea" from your dashboard
   - Or use the "+" button in the navigation

2. **Fill Out Your Idea**
   - **Title** (optional): Give your idea a catchy name
   - **Description** (required): Describe your business concept
   - Watch the character counter (50-5,000 characters)

3. **Review and Submit**

### Example Submission

```
Title: Smart Pet Feeding Assistant

Description: A smart pet feeder that uses AI to monitor pet eating habits and health indicators. Pet owners struggle with knowing if they're feeding their pets the right amount at the right times, especially when traveling or working long hours. Our device would track eating patterns, portion sizes, and integrate with vet records to provide personalized feeding recommendations. The target market includes busy pet owners, elderly pet owners who might forget feeding times, and health-conscious pet parents. Revenue would come from device sales ($199) plus monthly subscription for AI insights ($9.99/month).
