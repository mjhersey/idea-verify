3. Database query optimization (indexes, N+1 prevention)
4. Redis caching implemented for expensive operations
5. CDN configured for static assets
6. Load testing proves 100+ concurrent evaluations

**Dependencies:** Requires Epic 2-4 for complete system performance testing.

## Story 5.3: Monitoring & Observability

**As an operations engineer,**

2. Custom metrics for business KPIs
3. Error tracking with Sentry or similar
4. Uptime monitoring with alerts
5. Performance dashboards created
6. Log aggregation and search capability

**Dependencies:** Requires all system components from Epics 1-4.

## Story 5.4: AWS Infrastructure & Deployment

**As a DevOps engineer,**
**I want automated infrastructure provisioning and deployment,**
**so that we can reliably deploy updates.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. AWS CDK stacks for all infrastructure
2. Blue-green deployment configured
3. GitHub Actions deployment pipeline
4. Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
5. Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
6. Backup and disaster recovery plan
7. Zero-downtime deployment verified

**Dependencies:** Requires Epic 1 Story 1.7 for basic infrastructure foundation.

## Story 5.5: Documentation & Launch Preparation

**As a product owner,**
**I want comprehensive documentation and launch materials,**
**so that users can successfully use the platform.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. User documentation/help center
2. Advanced API documentation (rate limiting, webhooks, enterprise features)
3. Video tutorials created
4. Landing page optimized
5. SEO basics implemented
6. Analytics tracking configured
7. Beta user feedback incorporated
8. API versioning and deprecation policies documented

**Dependencies:** Requires Epic 2 Story 2.7 for basic API documentation foundation.

## Security Hardening Details

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with httpOnly cookies
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds ≥12

### Infrastructure Security

- **Network Security**: VPC with private subnets, security groups configured
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all communications, AES-256 for data at rest
- **Access Control**: IAM roles with least privilege principle
- **Secrets Management**: All API keys and credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all security events

### Security Monitoring

- **Intrusion Detection**: AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular container and dependency scans
- **Security Metrics**: Failed login attempts, suspicious API usage patterns
- **Incident Response**: Automated alerting for security events

---

## Performance Optimization Targets

### Frontend Performance

- **Initial Load**: <3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Bundle Size**: Main bundle <500KB, vendor bundle <1MB
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
- **Caching**: Service worker for offline functionality

### Backend Performance

- **API Response Time**:
  - Simple requests: <200ms
  - Evaluation submission: <500ms
  - Report generation: <30 seconds
- **Database Performance**: All queries <100ms average
- **Queue Processing**: Agent results processed within 1 minute

### Scaling Targets

- **Concurrent Users**: 1,000+ simultaneous users
- **Concurrent Evaluations**: 100+ parallel evaluations
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling supports 500+ connections
- **Memory Usage**: <2GB per service instance

---

## Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts (PagerDuty - Immediate)

- **Service Down**: Any core service unavailable >2 minutes
- **Database Issues**: Connection failures, slow queries >5 seconds
- **High Error Rate**: >5% error rate for >5 minutes
- **Security Events**: Failed authentication spikes, suspicious API usage

### Warning Alerts (Slack - Monitor)

- **Performance Degradation**: Response times >2x baseline
- **Resource Usage**: CPU >80%, Memory >85%, Disk >90%
- **Agent Failures**: Individual agent failure rate >10%
- **External API Issues**: LLM provider errors, rate limiting

### Business Metrics Dashboard

- **User Activity**: Daily/monthly active users, new registrations
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Completion rate, average duration, success rate
- **Revenue Metrics**: Conversion rate, upgrade requests, usage patterns
- **System Health**: Uptime, performance trends, error rates

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Pipeline

```
Feature Branch → Pull Request → Dev Deploy → Integration Tests →
Staging Deploy → E2E Tests → Production Deploy (Blue-Green)
```

### Deployment Automation

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All AWS resources defined in CDK
- **Database Migrations**: Automated with rollback capability
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout of new features
- **Rollback Plan**: One-click rollback to previous version

### Production Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment**: Health checks, dependency verification
2. **Blue-Green Switch**: Traffic gradually shifted to new version
3. **Post-deployment**: Automated smoke tests, monitoring validation
4. **Rollback Triggers**: Automatic rollback on failure thresholds
