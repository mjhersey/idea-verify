git clone <repository-url>
cd idea-verify

# Run automated setup script
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

- [ ] Setup script completed successfully
- [ ] All services are running (check with `docker-compose ps`)

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If the automated script doesn't work, follow the
[detailed manual setup guide](./DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md).

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

psql postgresql://dev_user:dev_password@localhost:5432/ai_validation_platform

# Or using Docker
docker exec -it ai-validation-postgres psql -U dev_user -d ai_validation_platform

   - [ ] Database operations work
   - [ ] Mock AI services respond

3. **Development Workflow:**
   - [ ] Make code changes
   - [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
   - [ ] Format code: `npm run format`
   - [ ] Commit changes successfully

4. **Stop Services:**

   ```bash

   # Stop other terminals manually (Ctrl+C)
   ```

   - [ ] All services stop cleanly

## üéâ You're Ready!

If all items above are checked, you're ready to start developing!

### Next Steps:

1. **Review open issues** - Find something to work on
2. **Read contribution guidelines** - Understand team standards
3. **Pick up your first task** - Start small with bug fixes or documentation
4. **Ask questions** - Don't hesitate to reach out to the team

### Daily Workflow Reference:

```bash
# Start your day
npm run dev:services && npm run dev:mocks
npm run dev:web & npm run dev:api & npm run dev:orchestrator

# End your day
npm run dev:down
```

### Emergency Reset (if things break):

```bash
npm run dev:down
docker system prune -f
rm -rf node_modules packages/*/node_modules
npm run install:all
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```
