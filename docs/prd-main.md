# AI-Powered Business Idea Validation Platform - Core PRD

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable entrepreneurs to validate business ideas through AI-powered comprehensive analysis in under 30 minutes
- Provide actionable, data-driven insights that go beyond surface-level AI responses
- Support iterative refinement of ideas through multiple evaluation cycles
- Create a scalable platform that can grow from free MVP to enterprise-grade validation tool
- Establish market leadership in AI-powered business validation

### Background Context

The entrepreneurial ecosystem loses billions in wasted effort on non-viable business ideas. Traditional validation methods are either too expensive (consulting firms charging $10K-50K) or too shallow (basic AI chat responses). This platform bridges that gap by orchestrating specialized AI agents that conduct real market research, competitive analysis, and feasibility studies using real-time data.

Unlike generic AI tools, our platform provides structured, consistent evaluation frameworks with progressive depth. Users can iteratively refine their ideas based on findings, mimicking the real entrepreneurial journey. The system is designed to start with free data sources for the MVP while building toward premium features using paid APIs and continuous monitoring.
