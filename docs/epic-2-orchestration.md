# Epic 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration & Real-time UI

**Epic Goal**: Implement the complete multi-agent evaluation system with
parallel processing and real-time progress visualization. This epic delivers the
core value proposition of comprehensive, transparent business analysis.

## Story 2.1: Agent Framework & Orchestration

**As a system architect,** **I want to implement the complete agent
orchestration framework,** **so that multiple specialized agents can work
together to evaluate ideas.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Agent base class/interface defined with standard methods
2. Message queue topics configured for each agent type
3. Orchestrator service managing agent lifecycle and coordination
4. Parallel agent execution where possible
5. Agent result aggregation logic
6. Error handling and retry mechanisms
7. Agent health monitoring

**Dependencies:** Requires Epic 1 foundation for basic orchestrator service.

## Story 2.2: Market Research Agent

**As a user,** **I want comprehensive market analysis of my idea,** **so that I
understand the market opportunity and size.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Agent analyzes market size (TAM/SAM/SOM calculations)
2. Identifies market trends using web scraping
3. Searches for industry reports and statistics
4. Generates market opportunity score (0-100)
5. Findings stored in structured format
6. Processing completes within 5 minutes

**Dependencies:** Requires Story 2.1 for agent framework.

## Story 2.3: Competitive Analysis Agent

**As a user,** **I want to understand my competition,** **so that I can identify
differentiation opportunities.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Agent identifies direct and indirect competitors
2. Analyzes competitor features and positioning
3. Searches for competitor pricing information
4. Creates competitive landscape visualization data
5. Generates competitive difficulty score (0-100)
6. Results include actionable gaps and opportunities

**Dependencies:** Requires Story 2.1 for agent framework.

## Story 2.4: Customer Research Agent

**As a user,** **I want to validate that customers need my solution,** **so that
I can confirm product-market fit potential.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Agent analyzes target customer segments
2. Searches forums/Reddit for problem validation
3. Identifies customer pain points and needs
4. Estimates willingness to pay
5. Generates customer validation score (0-100)
6. Provides persona recommendations

**Dependencies:** Requires Story 2.1 for agent framework.

## Story 2.5: WebSocket Integration & Real-time Updates

**As a user,** **I want to see live progress of my evaluation,** **so that I
know what's happening and when it will complete.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. WebSocket server integrated with Express
2. Real-time events for agent status changes
3. Progress percentage calculations
4. Streaming insights as discovered
5. Connection management and reconnection
6. Fallback to Server-Sent Events if needed

**Dependencies:** Requires Story 2.1 for orchestrator events.

## Story 2.6: Real-time Progress Dashboard UI

**As a user,** **I want a visual dashboard showing evaluation progress,** **so
that I can follow along with the analysis.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Dashboard showing all active agents
2. Visual progress bars for each agent
3. Live insight cards appearing as discovered
4. Estimated completion time
5. Agent status indicators (pending/active/complete/failed)
6. Smooth animations and transitions
7. Mobile-responsive layout

**Dependencies:** Requires Story 2.1 for agent framework and Story 2.5 for
WebSocket integration.

## Story 2.7: Basic API Documentation for Frontend Integration

**As a frontend developer,** **I want comprehensive API documentation for
integration,** **so that I can effectively build the user interface and connect
to backend services.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Core API Endpoints Documented:**
   - Authentication endpoints (login, register, token refresh)
   - Idea submission API (POST /api/ideas)
   - Evaluation status API (GET /api/evaluations/{id})
   - Results retrieval API (GET /api/evaluations/{id}/results)
   - User dashboard API (GET /api/user/evaluations)

2. **WebSocket Event Documentation:**
   - Connection establishment and authentication
   - Real-time event schemas (agent_progress, new_insight, evaluation_complete)
   - Error event handling and reconnection procedures
   - Message format specifications with examples

3. **Request/Response Schemas:**
   - TypeScript interfaces for all API models
   - Request body schemas with validation rules
   - Response body schemas with example data
   - Error response formats and status codes

4. **Integration Examples:**
   - Code samples for common API interactions
   - WebSocket connection and event handling examples
   - Authentication flow implementation guide
   - Error handling best practices

5. **Development Support:**
   - Interactive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Postman collection for API testing
   - Mock data examples for frontend development
   - Local development environment API endpoints

**Dependencies:** Requires Stories 2.1-2.5 for API implementation and Epic 1
Story 1.3 for authentication endpoints.

## Epic 2 Definition of Done

✅ **Multi-agent system operational** - 4+ specialized agents working in
parallel  
✅ **Real-time progress visualization** - Live updates via WebSockets with
fallbacks  
✅ **Comprehensive market intelligence** - Market, competitive, and customer
analysis  
✅ **Robust orchestration** - Error handling, retries, health monitoring  
✅ **Frontend-backend integration** - Complete API documentation and examples  
✅ **Performance targets met** - Full evaluation completes within 30 minutes

**Success Metrics:**

- 4+ agents complete evaluation in parallel within 30 minutes
- Real-time updates work seamlessly across desktop and mobile
- Agent failure rate <5% with graceful degradation
- WebSocket connection stability >95%
- Frontend developers can integrate without backend team support

**Key Risk Mitigations:**

- Mock agent responses for development/testing
- WebSocket fallback to Server-Sent Events
- Individual agent timeouts prevent system hang
- Rate limiting prevents external API quota exhaustion
