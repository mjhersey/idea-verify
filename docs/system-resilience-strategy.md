# System Resilience & Error Handling Strategy

This section defines comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies to
ensure robust user experience even when system components fail. Based on PO
Master Checklist validation recommendations.

## **Error Categories & Response Matrix**

| **Error Category**           | **Impact Level** | **User Experience**  | **System Response**              | **Recovery Time** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **LLM Provider Outage**      | High             | Evaluation delayed   | Switch to alternate provider     | 1-5 minutes       |
| **Individual Agent Failure** | Medium           | Partial results      | Continue with remaining agents   | Immediate         |
| **Database Connection Loss** | High             | Service unavailable  | Queue requests, retry connection | 2-10 minutes      |
| **WebSocket Disconnection**  | Low              | No real-time updates | Auto-reconnect, polling fallback | 5-30 seconds      |
| **External API Rate Limits** | Medium           | Slower evaluation    | Queue requests, distribute load  | 15-60 minutes     |
| **Infrastructure Failure**   | Critical         | Service unavailable  | Failover to backup region        | 10-30 minutes     |

## **1. LLM Provider Failure Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1A: Primary LLM Provider Unavailable**

**User Experience:**

- Evaluation continues with notice: "Using alternate AI provider due to
  temporary service issue"
- Slight delay (1-2 minutes) during provider switching
- Results quality maintained

**System Response:**

```
1. Detect OpenAI API failure (timeout >30s or 503/504 errors)
2. Automatically switch to Anthropic provider
3. Update user via WebSocket: "Switching to backup AI service..."
4. Continue evaluation with alternate provider
5. Log incident for monitoring
```

**Recovery Strategy:**

- Exponential backoff for primary provider reconnection attempts
- Load balancing between providers when both available
- Provider health monitoring every 60 seconds

### **Scenario 1B: All LLM Providers Unavailable**

**User Experience:**

- Clear message: "AI services temporarily unavailable. Your evaluation will
  resume automatically when service is restored."
- Option to save idea draft and get email notification when ready
- Estimated restoration time displayed

**System Response:**

```
1. Queue evaluation request in Redis
2. Send user confirmation email with ticket ID
3. Enable mock agent responses for development/testing
4. Retry every 5 minutes with exponential backoff
5. Process queued evaluations when service restored
```

## **2. Agent Failure Scenarios**

### **Scenario 2A: Single Agent Failure**

**User Experience:**

- Progress continues with 4/5 agents
- Notice: "Market Research analysis delayed - continuing with other evaluations"
- Final report notes missing analysis with explanation

**System Response:**

```
1. Agent timeout after 10 minutes
2. Mark agent as failed in orchestrator
3. Continue with remaining 4 agents
4. Generate partial report with 4 scores
5. Attempt to restart failed agent for next evaluation
```

### **Scenario 2B: Multiple Agent Failures (3+ agents fail)**

**User Experience:**

- Evaluation paused with message: "Service experiencing issues - your evaluation
  will resume shortly"
- Option to try again later or contact support
- No partial results shown (insufficient data)

**System Response:**

```
1. Orchestrator detects >50% agent failure
2. Pause evaluation and save current state
3. Restart agent services
4. Resume evaluation from last checkpoint
5. Escalate to engineering team if restart fails
```

## **3. Data Layer Failure Scenarios**

### **Scenario 3A: PostgreSQL Connection Loss**

**User Experience:**

- "Service temporarily unavailable - please try again in a few minutes"
- Previously saved evaluations temporarily inaccessible
- New submissions queued

**System Response:**

```
1. API Gateway detects database connection failure
2. Return 503 Service Unavailable to new requests
3. Queue new evaluation requests in Redis
4. Health check database every 30 seconds
5. Process queued requests when connection restored
```

### **Scenario 3B: Redis Cache/Queue Failure**

**User Experience:**

- Real-time updates temporarily unavailable
- Evaluations continue but progress updates delayed
- Results still accessible once complete

**System Response:**

```
1. Fall back to direct database writes
2. Disable real-time progress updates
3. Continue agent processing with database coordination
4. Restart Redis and restore queue processing
5. Resume real-time features when restored
```

## **4. Real-time Communication Failures**

### **Scenario 4A: WebSocket Connection Drop**

**User Experience:**

- Progress updates stop updating live
- Automatic reconnection attempt notification
- Page refresh option if reconnection fails

**System Response:**

```
1. Frontend detects WebSocket disconnection
2. Show "Reconnecting..." indicator
3. Attempt reconnection every 2^n seconds (max 30s)
4. Fall back to polling API every 10 seconds
5. Restore real-time updates when WebSocket reconnects
```

### **Scenario 4B: Server-Sent Events Fallback Failure**

**User Experience:**

- Manual refresh button to check progress
- "Check Status" button updates evaluation state
- Email notification when evaluation complete

**System Response:**

```
1. Disable all real-time features
2. Provide manual refresh capabilities
3. Send email notification on completion
4. Log incident for infrastructure team
5. Display evaluation results when user refreshes
```

## **5. External Service Failures**

### **Scenario 5A: Web Scraping Service Blocked**

**User Experience:**

- Market research continues with alternative data sources
- Notice: "Using cached market data due to external service limitations"
- Results include data freshness indicators

**System Response:**

```
1. Detect web scraping rate limits or blocks
2. Switch to cached public data sources
3. Use alternative APIs where available
4. Include data age warnings in results
5. Retry scraping after cooldown period
```

### **Scenario 5B: Public API Rate Limits Exceeded**

**User Experience:**

- Evaluation continues with available data
- "Some market data temporarily unavailable" notice
- Option to re-run analysis later for complete data

**System Response:**

```
1. Detect API rate limit responses (429 errors)
2. Queue requests for retry after reset time
3. Use cached data where available
4. Continue evaluation with partial data
5. Offer free re-evaluation when APIs restored
```

## **6. Infrastructure & Network Failures**

### **Scenario 6A: AWS Region Outage**

**User Experience:**

- "Service temporarily unavailable" maintenance page
- Email updates on restoration progress
- No data loss - all evaluations preserved

**System Response:**

```
1. Health check detects regional failure
2. DNS failover to backup region (if configured)
3. Or display maintenance page with status updates
4. Data synchronization when primary region restored
5. Resume normal operations
```

## **7. User-Facing Error Messages**

### **Error Message Standards:**

- **Clear & Non-Technical:** Avoid technical jargon, explain impact to user
- **Action-Oriented:** Always provide next steps or alternatives
- **Time-Bound:** Include estimated resolution times when possible
- **Empathetic:** Acknowledge frustration and inconvenience

### **Example Error Messages:**

**Good Error Message:**

```
"We're experiencing high demand for our AI services. Your evaluation is queued and will start within the next 10 minutes. We'll send you an email when it's complete."
[Save Draft] [Try Again Later] [Contact Support]
```

**Bad Error Message:**

```
"Error 503: OpenAI API timeout in agent orchestrator service"
```

## **8. Monitoring & Alerting Requirements**

### **Critical Alerts (Immediate Response):**

- All LLM providers unavailable (>5 minutes)
- Database connection lost (>2 minutes)
- > 3 agents failing simultaneously
- User-facing service completely down

### **Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely):**

- Single LLM provider unavailable
- Agent failure rate >20%
- WebSocket connection drop rate >50%
- External API rate limits reached

### **Metrics to Track:**

- Evaluation success rate (target: >95%)
- Average evaluation completion time
- Agent failure rates by type
- LLM provider response times
- WebSocket connection stability

## **9. Recovery Testing Requirements**

### **Chaos Engineering Tests:**

- Randomly kill agent processes during evaluation
- Simulate LLM provider outages
- Test database connection drops
- Verify WebSocket reconnection logic
- Validate queue processing after Redis restart

### **Load Testing Scenarios:**

- 100 concurrent evaluations with 1 LLM provider down
- Database connection flapping
- High WebSocket connection churn
- External API rate limiting under load

## **Success Criteria for Error Handling:**

✅ **User never loses their evaluation progress**  
✅ **Clear communication about issues and expected resolution**  
✅ **Graceful degradation maintains core functionality**  
✅ **Automatic recovery without user intervention when possible**  
✅ **No single point of failure causes complete service outage**

## **Detailed Implementation Guidelines**

### **Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation**

```typescript
class LLMProviderCircuitBreaker {
  private failureCount = 0
  private lastFailureTime = 0
  private state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN' = 'CLOSED'

  async callProvider(request: any): Promise<any> {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailureTime > 60000) {
        // 1 minute
        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN'
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN')
      }
    }

    try {
      const result = await this.makeAPICall(request)
      if (this.state === 'HALF_OPEN') {
        this.state = 'CLOSED'
        this.failureCount = 0
      }
      return result
    } catch (error) {
      this.failureCount++
      this.lastFailureTime = Date.now()

      if (this.failureCount >= 5) {
        this.state = 'OPEN'
      }
      throw error
    }
  }
}
```

### **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**

```typescript
async function retryWithBackoff<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
  baseDelay: number = 1000
): Promise<T> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation()
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) {
        throw error
      }

      const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt)
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay))
    }
  }
}
```

### **Graceful Degradation Example**

```typescript
class EvaluationService {
  async evaluateIdea(idea: string): Promise<EvaluationResult> {
    const agents = [
      'market-research',
      'competitive-analysis',
      'customer-research',
      'technical-feasibility',
      'financial-analysis',
    ]

    const results: AgentResult[] = []

    for (const agentType of agents) {
      try {
        const result = await this.runAgent(agentType, idea)
        results.push(result)
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(`Agent ${agentType} failed, continuing with others`)
        // Log failure but continue with other agents
      }
    }

    if (results.length < 3) {
      throw new Error('Insufficient agents completed - evaluation failed')
    }

    return this.generateReport(results)
  }
}
```

### **User-Facing Error Message Templates**

```typescript
const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  LLM_PROVIDER_DOWN: {
    title: 'AI Service Temporarily Unavailable',
    message:
      "We're switching to our backup AI service. Your evaluation will continue shortly.",
    action: 'Please wait while we resolve this automatically.',
    estimatedTime: '1-2 minutes',
  },

  PARTIAL_AGENT_FAILURE: {
    title: 'Evaluation Continuing with Available Data',
    message:
      "Some analysis components are experiencing delays, but we're proceeding with available information.",
    action:
      "You'll receive a partial report, and we'll update it when all services are restored.",
    estimatedTime: 'Normal completion time',
  },

  COMPLETE_SERVICE_DOWN: {
    title: 'Service Temporarily Unavailable',
    message:
      "We're experiencing technical difficulties and are working to restore service.",
    action:
      'Your evaluation has been saved and will resume automatically when service is restored.',
    estimatedTime: "We'll email you when ready",
  },
}
```

This comprehensive strategy ensures that users receive consistent, reliable
service even when individual components fail, maintaining trust and usability
throughout various failure scenarios.
