## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

From Stories 1.0 and 1.1 completion, the following database infrastructure is established:
- PostgreSQL 15+ running in Docker Compose with proper health checks [Source: Story 1.1 completion]
- Database name: `ai_validation_platform`, user: `dev_user`, configured with UTF-8 encoding
- Basic SQL schema in `tools/postgres-init/01-init-database.sql` with placeholder tables (users, business_evaluations, agent_executions)
- Environment variable configuration and secure credential management from Story 1.0
- Database connectivity validation script: `tools/test-database-connectivity.js`

### Database Design Architecture

The database follows microservices principles while using a shared PostgreSQL instance [Source: docs/technical-assumptions.md#database-choice]:

**Database Design Principles:**
- **Structured Data**: Users, evaluations, results in relational tables
- **Flexible Data**: Agent outputs and insights in JSONB columns
- **Performance**: Proper indexing on query patterns
- **Scalability**: Connection pooling and read replicas

**Technology Stack:** [Source: docs/technical-assumptions.md#backend-technologies]
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for TypeScript integration
- Connection pooling for scalability
- JSONB support for flexible agent data storage

### Required Data Models

Based on functional requirements analysis [Source: docs/prd-main.md#functional]:

**User Model:**
```typescript
model User {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  email        String   @unique
  password_hash String
  name         String
  created_at   DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  business_ideas BusinessIdea[]
}
```

**BusinessIdea Model:**
```typescript
model BusinessIdea {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  user_id     String
  title       String
  description String   // FR1: 50-5000 characters
  status      String   @default("draft") // draft, submitted, evaluating, completed
  created_at  DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at  DateTime @updatedAt
  
  user        User @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  evaluations Evaluation[]
}
```

**Evaluation Model:**
```typescript
model Evaluation {
  id               String    @id @default(uuid())
  business_idea_id String
  status           String    @default("pending") // pending, analyzing, completed, failed
  priority         String    @default("normal") // low, normal, high
  started_at       DateTime?
  completed_at     DateTime?
  results          Json?     // Final aggregated results
  error_message    String?
  created_at       DateTime  @default(now())
  updated_at       DateTime  @updatedAt
  
  business_idea   BusinessIdea @relation(fields: [business_idea_id], references: [id])
  agent_results   AgentResult[]
}
```

**AgentResult Model:**
```typescript
model AgentResult {
  id            String    @id @default(uuid())
  evaluation_id String
  agent_type    String    // market-research, competitive-analysis, customer-research, etc.
  status        String    @default("pending") // pending, running, completed, failed
  input_data    Json?     // Agent input parameters
  output_data   Json?     // Agent analysis results
  score         Float?    // 0-100 scoring
  insights      Json?     // Key insights and recommendations
  started_at    DateTime?
  completed_at  DateTime?
  error_message String?
  created_at    DateTime  @default(now())
  updated_at    DateTime  @updatedAt
  
  evaluation    Evaluation @relation(fields: [evaluation_id], references: [id])
}
```

### Database Configuration Requirements

**Connection Configuration:**
- Database URL: `postgresql://dev_user:dev_password@localhost:5432/ai_validation_platform`
- Connection pooling: 20 connections max for development, configurable for production
- Query timeout: 30 seconds default
- Integration with existing environment variable management from Story 1.0

**Performance Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd-main.md#non-functional]
- Support concurrent evaluation of 100+ business ideas (NFR3)
- Maintain sub-3-second page load times (NFR2)
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields (status, created_at, user_id, evaluation_id)

### Migration Strategy

**Migration Approach:**
- Replace existing basic SQL schema with proper Prisma migrations
- Preserve any existing development data during migration
- Implement backward-compatible changes for future migrations
- Use Prisma's migration history for version control

**Migration Files:**
- `001_initial_schema.sql` - Complete database schema with proper relationships
- `002_indexes_and_constraints.sql` - Performance optimizations
- `003_seed_data.sql` - Development seed data (separate from migration)

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**Packages Integration:**
- API package (`packages/api/`) - Primary location for Prisma schema and database operations
- Shared package (`packages/shared/`) - Export TypeScript types for cross-package usage
- Integration with existing credential management and environment configuration
- Compatibility with Docker Compose PostgreSQL service configuration

**Security Integration:**
- Use secure credential management from Story 1.0 for database connections
- Environment variable configuration for different deployment environments
- Connection string management through AWS Secrets Manager integration
- Input sanitization and SQL injection prevention through Prisma

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-02
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The database infrastructure implementation is comprehensive and follows senior-level architectural patterns. The Prisma schema design is excellent with proper relationships, indexes, and JSONB fields for flexible agent data. The repository pattern implementation provides clean abstraction with comprehensive CRUD operations, pagination, and error handling. Connection pooling and health monitoring are implemented with production-ready features.

### Refactoring Performed
During the review, I identified and fixed several critical issues in the testing infrastructure:

- **File**: `tests/database/test-factories.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed factory methods returning undefined values for required fields
  - **Why**: Factory.createMany() was generating undefined email/name values causing test failures
  - **How**: Updated to ensure unique timestamps and proper default values for all generated test data

- **File**: `tests/database/test-factories.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced cleanup function to filter undefined values
  - **Why**: Prisma validation was failing on arrays containing undefined values
  - **How**: Added filtering to remove undefined values before database operations

- **File**: `tests/database/performance.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated cleanup to use deleteMany instead of delete for safer error handling
  - **Why**: Hard delete operations were failing when records didn't exist
  - **How**: Replaced delete() with deleteMany() and added try-catch for graceful cleanup

- **File**: `tests/database/user-repository.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced beforeEach cleanup to include all test email patterns
  - **Why**: Test isolation was failing due to incomplete cleanup between tests
  - **How**: Added OR condition to clean up 'duplicate' and 'example.com' test emails

- **File**: `src/app.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed import to use getEnvironmentConfig instead of loadEnvironmentConfig
  - **Why**: Function name mismatch causing import errors in unit tests
  - **How**: Updated import and function call to match actual shared package exports
