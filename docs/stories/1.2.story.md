## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

From Stories 1.0 and 1.1 completion, the following database infrastructure is established:
- PostgreSQL 15+ running in Docker Compose with proper health checks [Source: Story 1.1 completion]
- Database name: `ai_validation_platform`, user: `dev_user`, configured with UTF-8 encoding
- Basic SQL schema in `tools/postgres-init/01-init-database.sql` with placeholder tables (users, business_evaluations, agent_executions)
- Environment variable configuration and secure credential management from Story 1.0
- Database connectivity validation script: `tools/test-database-connectivity.js`

### Database Design Architecture

The database follows microservices principles while using a shared PostgreSQL instance [Source: docs/technical-assumptions.md#database-choice]:

**Database Design Principles:**
- **Structured Data**: Users, evaluations, results in relational tables
- **Flexible Data**: Agent outputs and insights in JSONB columns
- **Performance**: Proper indexing on query patterns
- **Scalability**: Connection pooling and read replicas

**Technology Stack:** [Source: docs/technical-assumptions.md#backend-technologies]
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for TypeScript integration
- Connection pooling for scalability
- JSONB support for flexible agent data storage

### Required Data Models

Based on functional requirements analysis [Source: docs/prd-main.md#functional]:

**User Model:**
```typescript
model User {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  email        String   @unique
  password_hash String
  name         String
  created_at   DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  business_ideas BusinessIdea[]
}
```

**BusinessIdea Model:**
```typescript
model BusinessIdea {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  user_id     String
  title       String
  description String   // FR1: 50-5000 characters
  status      String   @default("draft") // draft, submitted, evaluating, completed
  created_at  DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at  DateTime @updatedAt
  
  user        User @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  evaluations Evaluation[]
}
```

**Evaluation Model:**
```typescript
model Evaluation {
  id               String    @id @default(uuid())
  business_idea_id String
  status           String    @default("pending") // pending, analyzing, completed, failed
  priority         String    @default("normal") // low, normal, high
  started_at       DateTime?
  completed_at     DateTime?
  results          Json?     // Final aggregated results
  error_message    String?
  created_at       DateTime  @default(now())
  updated_at       DateTime  @updatedAt
  
  business_idea   BusinessIdea @relation(fields: [business_idea_id], references: [id])
  agent_results   AgentResult[]
}
```

**AgentResult Model:**
```typescript
model AgentResult {
  id            String    @id @default(uuid())
  evaluation_id String
  agent_type    String    // market-research, competitive-analysis, customer-research, etc.
  status        String    @default("pending") // pending, running, completed, failed
  input_data    Json?     // Agent input parameters
  output_data   Json?     // Agent analysis results
  score         Float?    // 0-100 scoring
  insights      Json?     // Key insights and recommendations
  started_at    DateTime?
  completed_at  DateTime?
  error_message String?
  created_at    DateTime  @default(now())
  updated_at    DateTime  @updatedAt
  
  evaluation    Evaluation @relation(fields: [evaluation_id], references: [id])
}
```

### Database Configuration Requirements

**Connection Configuration:**
- Database URL: `postgresql://dev_user:dev_password@localhost:5432/ai_validation_platform`
- Connection pooling: 20 connections max for development, configurable for production
- Query timeout: 30 seconds default
- Integration with existing environment variable management from Story 1.0

**Performance Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd-main.md#non-functional]
- Support concurrent evaluation of 100+ business ideas (NFR3)
- Maintain sub-3-second page load times (NFR2)
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields (status, created_at, user_id, evaluation_id)

### Migration Strategy

**Migration Approach:**
- Replace existing basic SQL schema with proper Prisma migrations
- Preserve any existing development data during migration
- Implement backward-compatible changes for future migrations
- Use Prisma's migration history for version control

**Migration Files:**
- `001_initial_schema.sql` - Complete database schema with proper relationships
- `002_indexes_and_constraints.sql` - Performance optimizations
- `003_seed_data.sql` - Development seed data (separate from migration)

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**Packages Integration:**
- API package (`packages/api/`) - Primary location for Prisma schema and database operations
- Shared package (`packages/shared/`) - Export TypeScript types for cross-package usage
- Integration with existing credential management and environment configuration
- Compatibility with Docker Compose PostgreSQL service configuration

**Security Integration:**
- Use secure credential management from Story 1.0 for database connections
- Environment variable configuration for different deployment environments
- Connection string management through AWS Secrets Manager integration
- Input sanitization and SQL injection prevention through Prisma

### Testing Strategy
