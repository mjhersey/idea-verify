  targetMarket, category, geography), analysisType, context, options
- `AgentResponse` interface with agentType, score (0-100), insights, confidence,
  metadata, rawData
- `AgentExecutionContext` with evaluationId, correlationId, userId, timestamp
- `AgentCapability` defining name, version, dependencies, provides, requires
  arrays

**Business Idea Types:** [Source: packages/shared/src/types/businessIdea.ts]

- `BusinessIdea` interface with id, user_id, title, description, status,
  timestamps
- Standard status types: 'draft' | 'submitted' | 'evaluating' | 'completed'

**Customer Research Data Models:** [Derived from market research patterns in
packages/orchestrator/src/market-research/schemas/market-research-types.ts]

- `CustomerResearchOutput` interface with segments array, pain points,
  validation score, personas
- `CustomerSegment` interface with demographics, psychographics, behavior
  patterns, size estimation
- `PainPointAnalysis` interface with problem description, severity, frequency,
  customer quotes
- `WillingnessToPayAnalysis` interface with pricing insights, affordability
  assessment, value perception

  needs, pain points
- `ValidationInsight` interface with insight text, confidence score, supporting
  evidence, source attribution
- `DataSource` interface with name, url, lastUpdated, reliability score for
  citation tracking

**Scoring and Confidence Patterns:** [Source:
packages/orchestrator/src/market-research/schemas/market-research-types.ts]

- All scores use 0-100 scale for consistency with established agent patterns
- Confidence levels: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' with numerical confidence scores
  (0-100)
- Multiple validation methodologies with assumption tracking

- Survey and review platforms for pain point identification
- Public demographic and psychographic data sources
- Fallback strategies for unavailable sources with graceful degradation

### Component Specifications

**Customer Research Agent Class:** [Source: packages/orchestrator/src/agents/
patterns]
