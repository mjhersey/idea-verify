  arrays

**Business Idea Types:** [Source: packages/shared/src/types/businessIdea.ts]

- `BusinessIdea` interface with id, user_id, title, description, status,
  timestamps

- Testing approach matches established unit testing strategy
- Integration points match existing BaseAgent framework and message queue
  architecture
