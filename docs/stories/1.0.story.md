# Story 1.0: External Service Setup & Environment Foundation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to establish all external service dependencies and secure credential management,
**so that** development can proceed without external service blockers and with proper security practices in place.

## Acceptance Criteria

### External Service Account Setup (User Responsibility)

1. **LLM Provider Accounts Created:**

   - User creates OpenAI account with API access enabled
   - User creates Anthropic account with Claude API access
   - User documents account details and tier limits in shared secure location
   - User obtains initial API credits/billing setup for development phase

2. **AWS Account Preparation:**
   - User creates AWS account or confirms existing account access
   - User sets up billing alerts and cost monitoring
   - User creates IAM user with programmatic access for development
   - User documents AWS account ID and initial access credentials

### API Key & Credential Management (User → Agent Handoff)

3. **Secure Credential Provision:**

   - User generates API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic
   - User creates AWS access keys for development IAM user
   - User provides credentials through secure channel (encrypted file, password manager, etc.)

   - Credential validation scripts created to test all external connections

### Development Resilience & Offline Support

5. **Mock Services for Development:**

   - Mock OpenAI API service created returning realistic evaluation data
   - Mock Anthropic API service created with similar response formats
   - Mock S3 service (localstack) configured for local development
   - Development environment can run completely offline using mocks

6. **Rate Limiting & Quota Management:**
   - API rate limiting configurations documented for each service
   - Request retry logic with exponential backoff implemented
   - API quota monitoring and alerting configured
   - Fallback strategies defined when quotas are exceeded

### Service Integration Validation

7. **Connection Testing & Validation:**

   - Automated test suite validates all external service connections
   - Health check endpoints created for each external service

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This is the foundational story that establishes all external dependencies required for the AI-Powered Business Idea Validation Platform. The system employs a microservices architecture within a monorepo structure. [Source: docs/architecture.md#high-level-architecture]

### Project Structure Alignment

The monorepo structure is defined as follows [Source: docs/technical-assumptions.md#monorepo-organization]:

```
ai-validation-platform/
├── packages/
│   ├── web/                 # Vue.js frontend application
│   ├── api/                 # Express.js API Gateway
│   ├── orchestrator/        # Agent orchestration service
│   ├── agents/              # Individual AI agent services
│   ├── shared/              # Shared utilities and types
│   └── infrastructure/      # AWS CDK infrastructure code
├── tools/                   # Build tools and scripts
├── docs/                    # Documentation
└── docker-compose.yml      # Local development environment
```

### External Service Requirements

The platform integrates with the following external services [Source: docs/architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]:

- **OpenAI API**: For LLM processing (primary provider)
- **Anthropic Claude API**: For LLM processing (backup provider)
- **AWS Services**: EC2, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, ElastiCache Redis, CloudWatch, API Gateway
- **Target Region**: us-east-1 (lowest cost, most services available)

### Security & Credential Management

All credentials must be stored securely using AWS Secrets Manager. The system implements [Source: docs/technical-assumptions.md#security-measures]:

- Encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3, AES-256)
- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Comprehensive audit trail for all security events
- JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh

### Mock Services for Development

Development environment must support complete offline operation using mock services [Source: docs/technical-assumptions.md#additional-technical-assumptions]:

- Mock OpenAI API returning realistic evaluation data
- Mock Anthropic API with similar response formats
- Mock S3 service using localstack
- Cached data where available for development scenarios

### Error Handling & Resilience

Implementation must include comprehensive error handling [Source: docs/system-resilience-strategy.md]:

- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Provider health monitoring every 60 seconds
