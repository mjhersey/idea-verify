  metadata, rawData
- `AgentExecutionContext` with evaluationId, correlationId, userId, timestamp
- `AgentCapability` defining name, version, dependencies, provides, requires
  arrays

**Business Idea Types:** [Source: packages/shared/src/types/businessIdea.ts]

- `BusinessIdea` interface with id, user_id, title, description, status,
  timestamps

## Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Established Patterns:** [Source:
packages/orchestrator/src/market-research/ structure]

- Following modular architecture established in Story 2.2 with separate analysis
  engines
- Maintaining consistent file naming conventions and directory structure
- Agent located in standard `packages/orchestrator/src/agents/` directory
- Analysis engines organized in
  `packages/orchestrator/src/competitive-analysis/` subdirectories
- Type definitions in `schemas/` subdirectory following established pattern
- Test files in `packages/orchestrator/tests/unit/` following naming convention

**No Structural Conflicts Identified:**

- All proposed file paths align with existing project structure
- TypeScript interface patterns consistent with shared types in
  `packages/shared/src/types/`
- Testing approach matches established unit testing strategy
- Integration points match existing BaseAgent framework and message queue
  architecture

**Dependencies Satisfied:**

- Story 2.1 (Agent Framework) completed - provides BaseAgent class and
  orchestration framework
- Market research patterns established in Story 2.2 - provides architectural
  templates and best practices
- Shared type definitions available - provides BusinessIdea and pagination
  interfaces
- Frontend architecture defined - provides WebSocket integration patterns for
  real-time updates
