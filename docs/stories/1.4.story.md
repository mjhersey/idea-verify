### Data Models

**Source: Story 1.2 Database Implementation + Prisma Schema**

- BusinessIdea model exists with fields: `id` (uuid), `user_id`, `title`,
  `description`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  `[Source: packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma]`
- Status field defaults to "draft" with states: draft, submitted, evaluating,
  completed `[Source: packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma]`
- Description field is String type supporting 50-5000 characters per FR1
  requirement `[Source: packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma]`
- Foreign key relationship to User model with CASCADE delete
  `[Source: packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma]`
- Indexes configured on user_id, status, and created_at for query performance
  `[Source: packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma]`
- BusinessIdea repository pattern ready to be implemented following
  UserRepository example `[Source: Story 1.2 completion]`

  structure
  `[Source: packages/api/src/routes/auth.ts#validation error handling]`
- **Service Layer**: Business logic in separate service file following
  authService pattern
  `[Source: packages/api/src/services/authService.ts pattern]`

### File Locations

**Source: Project Structure and Established Patterns**

- **API Routes**: `packages/api/src/routes/ideas.ts` for business idea endpoints
  `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Monorepo Organization]`
- **Service Layer**: `packages/api/src/services/businessIdeaService.ts` for
  business logic `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Monorepo Organization]`
- **Repository**: Use existing
  `packages/api/src/repositories/business-idea-repository.ts` from Story 1.2
  `[Source: Story 1.2 completion]`
- **Types**: `packages/shared/src/types/businessIdea.ts` for shared TypeScript

  methods `[Source: frontend-architecture.md#Project Structure]`
- **Controllers**: Consider `packages/api/src/controllers/ideas.ts` if following
  existing evaluation controller pattern
  `[Source: packages/api/src/controllers/evaluations.ts]`

### Testing Requirements

**Source: Technical Assumptions Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: >90% coverage for business idea service logic using Vitest
  `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Testing Strategy Details]`
- **Integration Tests**: POST /api/ideas endpoint with real database connection
  `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Testing Strategy Details]`
- **Security Tests**: XSS prevention, input sanitization, rate limiting
  validation `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Testing Strategy Details]`
- **Authentication Tests**: JWT token requirement and user association
  verification `[Source: Story 1.3 patterns]`
- **Performance Tests**: Database operation performance and concurrent request
  handling `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Testing Strategy Details]`

### Technical Constraints

**Source: Architecture Documents and Previous Story Patterns**

- **Database Integration**: Must use Prisma ORM and BusinessIdea model from
  Story 1.2 `[Source: Story 1.2 completion]`
- **Authentication**: Must use JWT middleware from Story 1.3 for user
  identification `[Source: Story 1.3 completion]`
- **Rate Limiting**: Follow express-rate-limit patterns from auth routes
  `[Source: packages/api/src/routes/auth.ts patterns]`
- **Validation**: Use express-validator library with established error handling
  patterns `[Source: packages/api/src/routes/auth.ts patterns]`
- **Error Handling**: Follow established error response format with structured
  logging `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Error Recovery]`
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
  `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Technology Stack Details]`

### Security Considerations

**Source: Technical Assumptions Security Architecture + Epic Requirements**

- **Input Sanitization**: HTML sanitization and XSS prevention for
  user-generated content `[Source: epic-1-foundation.md#Story 1.4 AC6]`
- **Content Validation**: Check for inappropriate content, spam patterns,
  excessive length `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Input Validation]`
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/minute per user to prevent abuse
  `[Source: epic-1-foundation.md#Story 1.4 AC5]`
- **Authentication Required**: JWT token validation for all idea submission
  endpoints `[Source: epic-1-foundation.md#Story 1.4 Dependencies]`
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation regardless of frontend validation
  `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Application Security]`
- **Audit Logging**: Log all idea submissions for security monitoring
  `[Source: technical-assumptions.md#Observability Stack]`

### Integration Points

**Source: Current Codebase Analysis**

- **Existing Evaluation System**: Current evaluation controller uses in-memory
  storage with TODO for database integration
  `[Source: packages/api/src/controllers/evaluations.ts]`
- **Business Idea to Evaluation Flow**: Story 1.4 creates business ideas that
  Story 1.5 will evaluate
  `[Source: epic-1-foundation.md#Story 1.5 Dependencies]`
- **Response Format Alignment**: Consider aligning with existing controller
  response format `{ success, data/error }`
  `[Source: packages/api/src/controllers/evaluations.ts]`
- **Future Orchestration**: Business ideas will trigger evaluation requests in
  Story 1.5 `[Source: epic-1-foundation.md#Story 1.5]`
