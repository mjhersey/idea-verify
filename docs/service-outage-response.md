# Service Outage Response Procedures

## Overview

This document defines the step-by-step procedures for responding to external
service outages and maintaining platform availability during service
disruptions.

## Outage Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level             | Description                         | Response Time | Examples                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **P1 - Critical** | Complete service unavailable        | < 5 minutes   | All API calls failing, service returns 5xx  |
| **P2 - High**     | Degraded performance                | < 15 minutes  | High latency, intermittent failures         |
| **P3 - Medium**   | Partial functionality affected      | < 1 hour      | Rate limiting, specific endpoints down      |
| **P4 - Low**      | Minor issues, workarounds available | < 4 hours     | Documentation issues, non-critical features |

### Service Impact Matrix

| Service             | Impact Level | Fallback Available  | Recovery Strategy       |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| OpenAI API          | High         | Yes (Anthropic)     | Automatic failover      |
| Anthropic API       | Medium       | Yes (OpenAI)        | Manual failover         |
| AWS Secrets Manager | Critical     | No                  | Emergency credentials   |
| AWS S3              | Medium       | Yes (Local storage) | Temporary local storage |
| LocalStack          | Low          | N/A (Dev only)      | Docker restart          |

## Detection and Alerting

### Automated Detection

The platform continuously monitors service health through:

```typescript
// Health monitoring setup
const monitors = new ServiceHealthMonitors()
monitors.startAllMonitoring()

// Custom alert thresholds
const alertConfig = {
  consecutiveFailures: 3,
  responseTimeThreshold: 5000, // 5 seconds
  errorRateThreshold: 10, // 10%
}
```

### Alert Channels

1. **Automated Monitoring:**
   - Health check failures (3 consecutive)
   - Response time > 5 seconds
   - Error rate > 10%
   - Quota exhaustion alerts

2. **External Monitoring:**
   - Service status pages
   - Provider notifications
   - Third-party monitoring services

3. **Internal Notifications:**
   - Slack/Teams alerts
   - Email notifications
   - Dashboard indicators

## Response Procedures

### P1 - Critical Outage Response

**Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes):**

1. **Activate Emergency Fallback:**

   ```bash
   # Enable mock services immediately
   export USE_MOCK_SERVICES=true
   npm run mock:start

   # Verify mock services are healthy
   npm run mock:validate
   ```

2. **Notify Stakeholders:**

   ```bash
   # Send automated notification
   ./scripts/send-outage-alert.sh --severity=P1 --service=openai

   # Update status page
   ./scripts/update-status-page.sh --status=degraded
   ```

3. **Verify Impact:**

   ```bash
   # Check system functionality with mocks
   npm run test:integration:full

   # Monitor error rates
   tail -f logs/application.log | grep ERROR
   ```

**Short-term Actions (5-30 minutes):**

1. **Implement Service Failover:**

   ```typescript
   // Automatic failover configuration
   const failoverConfig = {
     primary: 'openai',
     secondary: 'anthropic',
     fallback: 'mock-services',
     maxRetries: 3,
     timeout: 10000,
   }
   ```

2. **Scale Mock Services:**

   ```bash
   # Increase mock service capacity
   docker-compose up --scale mock-openai=3 --scale mock-anthropic=3

   # Monitor mock service performance
   npm run monitor:mocks
   ```

3. **Communicate with Users:**
   ```
   "We're experiencing issues with our AI services.
   The platform is operating with backup systems.
   Some features may have reduced functionality."
   ```

**Recovery Actions (30+ minutes):**

1. **Monitor Service Recovery:**

   ```bash
   # Continuous service health monitoring
   watch -n 30 'npm run validate:credentials'

   # Check provider status pages
   curl -s https://status.openai.com/api/v2/status.json
   ```

2. **Gradual Service Restoration:**

   ```bash
   # Test service availability
   npm run test:integration -- --real-services

   # Gradually switch traffic back
   export FAILOVER_PERCENTAGE=10  # Start with 10%
   npm run enable:gradual-failback
   ```

3. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Document incident timeline
   - Review response effectiveness
   - Update procedures based on learnings

### P2 - High Impact Response

**Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes):**

1. **Assess Impact:**

   ```bash
   # Check current error rates
   grep -c "ERROR" logs/application.log | tail -10

   # Monitor response times
   npm run monitor:performance
   ```

2. **Enable Rate Limiting Protection:**

   ```typescript
   // Reduce request rate to affected service
   const protectiveConfig = {
     requestsPerMinute: 50, // Reduce by 50%
     maxRetries: 5, // Increase retries
     baseDelayMs: 2000, // Increase delay
   }
   ```

3. **Prepare Fallback:**
   ```bash
   # Warm up alternative services
   npm run warmup:anthropic
   npm run mock:start  # Have mocks ready
   ```

**Ongoing Actions:**

1. **Monitor and Adjust:**

   ```bash
   # Continuous monitoring
   watch -n 60 'npm run system:health'

   # Adjust rate limits based on performance
   npm run adjust:rate-limits --service=openai --reduction=25
   ```

2. **User Communication:**
   ```
   "We're experiencing slower response times with our AI services.
   We're working to resolve the issue. Thank you for your patience."
   ```

### P3 - Medium Impact Response

**Actions (0-1 hour):**

1. **Implement Workarounds:**

   ```typescript
   // Use alternative endpoints or methods
   const workaroundConfig = {
     useAlternativeModels: true,
     reducedFeatureSet: true,
     cachingEnabled: true,
   }
   ```

2. **Optimize Performance:**

   ```bash
   # Enable aggressive caching
   export CACHE_TTL=3600  # 1 hour cache
   npm run enable:caching

   # Use cheaper/faster models
   export PREFERRED_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
   ```

### P4 - Low Impact Response

**Actions (0-4 hours):**

1. **Schedule Maintenance:**
   - Plan fix during low-usage hours
   - Communicate maintenance window
   - Prepare rollback procedures

2. **Document Workarounds:**
   - Update user documentation
   - Create temporary user guides
   - Notify support team
